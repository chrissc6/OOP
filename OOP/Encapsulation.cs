//Encapsulation- objects should hide their implementation details from the caller,
//when we call a method on a class, we dont want the calling class to know whats going inside it
//Allows for code to be simpler to read and understand
//Allows for the protection of the internal state of an object,
//data can be set to be accessed through our methods and our properties
